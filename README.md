# BrilliantCiphers

This is an interactive Jupyter Notebook lesson displaying the frequency analysis of letters given the use of a cipher and how this might be used to decipher an encrypted piece of text. You're free to change the code and try it out yourself too :)

To start the interactive notebook click 'launch binder' below. Once it's loaded (when it's the first time this may take a couple of minutes) go to FrequencyVisualizer.ipynb.

To use the interactive components don't forget to run the code cells :)
